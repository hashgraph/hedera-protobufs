### CryptoAddLiveHashTransactionBody
Add a hash value to the ledger and associate it with an account.

Create an entry in the ledger for a SHA-384 hash of some content, and
associate that with a specific account.  This is sometimes used to associate
a credential or certificate with an account as a public record.<br/>
The entry created is also associated with a list of keys, all of which
MUST sign this transaction.<br/>
The account key for the associated account MUST sign this transaction.<br/>

The live hash, once created, MAY be removed from the ledger with one
or more signatures.
- The account key of the account associated to the live hash.
- Any one key from the key list in the live hash entry.
- Any combination of keys from the key list in the live hash entry.

### LiveHash
A Live Hash value associating some item of content to an account.

This message represents a desired entry in the ledger for a SHA-384
hash of some content, an associated specific account, a list of authorized
keys, and a duration the live hash is "valid".


| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| accountId | [AccountID](#proto-AccountID) | An account associated via this live hash to the hashed content. |
| hash | [bytes](#bytes) | A SHA-384 hash of some content that is associated to the account or account holder. |
| keys | [KeyList](#proto-KeyList) | A list of keys, all of which MUST sign the transaction to add the live hash.<br/> Any one of these keys may, however, remove the live hash to revoke the association. |
| duration | [Duration](#proto-Duration) | A duration describing how long this Live Hash SHALL remain valid.<br/> A Live Hash SHOULD NOT be relied upon after this duration has elapsed. |
