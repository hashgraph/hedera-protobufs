| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| topicID | [TopicID](#proto-TopicID) | The topic ID specifying the topic to update. <p> A topic with this ID MUST exist and MUST NOT be deleted.<br/> This value is REQUIRED. |
| memo | [google.protobuf.StringValue](#google-protobuf-StringValue) | An updated memo to be associated with this topic. <p> If this value is set, the current `adminKey` for the topic MUST sign this transaction.<br/> This value, if set, SHALL be encoded UTF-8 and SHALL NOT exceed 100 bytes when so encoded. |
| expirationTime | [Timestamp](#proto-Timestamp) | An updated expiration time for this topic, in seconds since the epoch. <p> For this purpose, `epoch` SHALL be the UNIX epoch with 0 at `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`.<br/> The expirationTime MUST NOT be greater than the sum of `MAX_AUTORENEW_PERIOD` and the actual consensus timestamp of this transaction.<br/> If `adminKey` is <b>unset</b> for the _topic_, this transaction MUST NOT modify any other field. |
| adminKey | [Key](#proto-Key) | Updated access control for modification of the topic. <p> If this field is set, that key and the previously set key MUST both sign this transaction.<br/> If this value is an empty `KeyList`, the prior key MUST sign this transaction, and the topic SHALL be immutable after this transaction completes, except for expiration and renewal. |
| submitKey | [Key](#proto-Key) | Updated access control for message submission to the topic. <p> If this value is set, the current `adminKey` for the topic MUST sign this transaction.<br/> If this value is set to an empty `KeyList`, the `submitKey` for the topic will be unset after this transaction completes. When the `submitKey` is unset, any account may submit a message on the topic, without restriction. |
| autoRenewPeriod | [Duration](#proto-Duration) | An updated value for the number of seconds by which the topic expiration will be automatically extended upon expiration, if it has a valid auto-renew account. <p> If this value is set, the current `adminKey` for the topic MUST sign this transaction.<br/> This value, if set, MUST be greater than the configured MIN_AUTORENEW_PERIOD.<br/> This value, if set, MUST be less than the configured MAX_AUTORENEW_PERIOD. |
| autoRenewAccount | [AccountID](#proto-AccountID) | An updated ID for the account to be charged renewal fees at the topic's `expirationTime` to extend the lifetime of the topic. <p> If this value is set and not the "sentinel account", the referenced account MUST sign this transaction.<br/> If this value is set, the current `adminKey` for the topic MUST sign this transaction.<br/> If this value is set to the "sentinel account", which is `0.0.0`, the `autoRenewAccount` SHALL be removed from the topic. |
