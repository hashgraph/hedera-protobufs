# Crypto Get Account Records
Messages for a query to retrieve recent transaction records involving a
specified account as effective `payer`.<br/>
A "recent" transaction is typically one that reached consensus within
the previous three(`3`) minutes of _consensus_ time. Additionally, the
network only stores records in state when
`ledger.keepRecordsInState=true` was true during transaction handling.

### Keywords
