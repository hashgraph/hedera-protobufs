### Keywords

### CongestionLevelStarts
Two lists of congestion pricing level "start" times. Each list details the
start of each time period when the congestion pricing level changed
(increasing, or decreasing, the congestion fee multiplier).

> Review Question
>> What prunes these lists?
>
>> Do these grow indefinitely?
>
>> Are these two lists the same size?


| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| generic_level_starts | [Timestamp](#proto-Timestamp) | Timestamps for each point where "entity utilization" congestion pricing levels changed. <p> If congestion pricing has not occurred then this SHALL contain a single timestamp of value 0. |
| gas_level_starts | [Timestamp](#proto-Timestamp) | Timestamps for each point where "gas utilization" congestion pricing levels changed. <p> If congestion pricing has not occurred then this SHALL contain a single timestamp of value 0. |
