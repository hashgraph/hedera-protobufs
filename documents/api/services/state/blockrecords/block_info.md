# Block Info
Information about the most recent block; including block hashes, current and
previous start times, etc...

### Keywords
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

### BlockInfo
Information for a transaction block.

This includes:
- last block number.
- consensus times for:
   - previous block start.
   - current block start.
   - last handled transaction.
- hash data for a rolling window of 256 blocks.
- whether migration records were produced.


| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| last_block_number | [int64](#int64) | A block number. <p> The block number of the last completed immutable block. |
| first_cons_time_of_last_block | [Timestamp](#proto-Timestamp) | A consensus timestamp. <p> The consensus time of the first transaction for the last completed immutable block. |
| block_hashes | [bytes](#bytes) | A list of the last 256 block hashes.<br/> This is the SHA384 48 byte hashes of the previous 256 blocks, collected in a single byte array. <p> The first 48 bytes SHALL be the oldest block in the list.<br/> The last 48 bytes SHALL be the newest block, which is the last fully completed immutable block.<br/> This SHALL contain less than 256 block hashes if there are less than 256 preceding blocks; for instance, shortly after network genesis the network will not have processed 256 blocks yet. <p> This MAY change significantly for Block Stream (HIP TBD). |
| cons_time_of_last_handled_txn | [Timestamp](#proto-Timestamp) | A consensus timestamp. <p> The consensus time of the last transaction that was handled by the node within the current block.<br/> This property is how we 'advance the consensus clock'. The node MUST continually set this property to the consensus timestamp for the most recent transaction completed by the node. |
| migration_records_streamed | [bool](#bool) | A flag indicating that migration records have been published. <p> This property SHALL be `false` immediately following a node upgrade<br/> This SHALL be set 'true' as migration records, if any, are published. Migration records are typically published "during" the first transaction handled by the node following startup. |
| first_cons_time_of_current_block | [Timestamp](#proto-Timestamp) | A consensus timestamp. <p> The consensus time of the first transaction in the current block; necessary for reconnecting nodes to detect when the current block is finished. |
