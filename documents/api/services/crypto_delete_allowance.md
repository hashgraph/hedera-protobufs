### CryptoDeleteAllowanceTransactionBody
Delete one or more allowances.<br/>
Given one or more, previously approved, allowances for non-fungible/unique
tokens to be transferred by a spending account from an owning account;
this transaction removes a specified set of those allowances.

The owner account for each listed allowance MUST sign this transaction.<br/>
Allowances for HBAR cannot be removed with this transaction. The owner
account MUST submit a new `cryptoApproveAllowance` transaction with the
amount set to `0` to "remove" that allowance.<br/>
Allowances for fungible/common tokens cannot be removed with this
transaction. The owner account MUST submit a new `cryptoApproveAllowance`
transaction with the amount set to `0` to "remove" that allowance.<br/>

<a name="proto-NftRemoveAllowance"></a>

### NftRemoveAllowance
A single allowance for one non-fungible/unique token.
This is specific to removal, and the allowance is identified for that
specific purpose.

All fields in this message are REQUIRED.
The `serial_numbers` list MUST NOT be empty.
The combination of field values in this message MUST match existing
allowances for one or more individual non-fungible/unique tokens.

### Removing an allowance that is `approve_for_all`
To remove an allowance that has set the `approve_for_all` flag, the
`owner` account must first _approve_ a **new** allowance for a specific
serial number using a `cryptoApproveAllowance`, and then, if desired,
that newly approved allowance to a specific serial number may be
deleted in a separate `cryptoDeleteAllowance` transaction.


| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| token_id | [TokenID](#proto-TokenID) | A token identifier. <p> This MUST be a valid token identifier for a non-fungible/unique token type. |
| owner | [AccountID](#proto-AccountID) | An `owner` account identifier. <p> This account MUST sign the transaction containing this message. |
| serial_numbers | [int64](#int64) | The list of serial numbers to remove allowances from. <p> This list MUST NOT be empty. |
