<a name="proto-TransactionGetFastRecordQuery"></a>

### TransactionGetFastRecordQuery
Get the tx record of a transaction, given its transaction ID.

Once a transaction reaches consensus, then information about whether it
succeeded or failed will be available until the end of the receipt period.
Before and after the receipt period, and for a transaction that was never
submitted, the receipt is unknown.<br/>
This query is free (the payment field is left empty).


| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| header | [QueryHeader](#proto-QueryHeader) | Standard information sent with every query operation.<br/> This includes the signed payment and what kind of response is requested (cost, state proof, both, or neither). |
| transactionID | [TransactionID](#proto-TransactionID) | The ID of the transaction for which the record is requested. |






<a name="proto-TransactionGetFastRecordResponse"></a>

### TransactionGetFastRecordResponse
Response when the client sends the node TransactionGetFastRecordQuery.
If it created a new entity (account, file, or smart contract instance) then
one of the three ID fields will be filled in with the ID of the new entity.
Sometimes a single transaction will create more than one new entity, such
as when a new contract instance is created, and this also creates the new
account that it owned by that instance.


| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| header | [ResponseHeader](#proto-ResponseHeader) | The standard response information for queries.<br/> This includes the values requested in the `QueryHeader` (cost, state proof, both, or neither). |
| transactionRecord | [TransactionRecord](#proto-TransactionRecord) | The requested transaction records |
