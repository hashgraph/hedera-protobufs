### NetworkService
Basic "network information" queries.

This service supports queries for the active services and API versions,
and a query for account details.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| getVersionInfo | [Query](#proto-Query) | [Response](#proto-Response) | Retrieve the active versions of Hedera Services and API messages. |
| getAccountDetails | [Query](#proto-Query) | [Response](#proto-Response) | Request detail information about an account. <p> The returned information SHALL include balance and allowances.<br/> The returned information SHALL NOT include a list of account records. |
| getExecutionTime | [Query](#proto-Query) | [Response](#proto-Response) | Retrieve the time, in nanoseconds, spent in direct processing for one or more recent transactions. <p> For each transaction identifier provided, if that transaction is sufficiently recent (that is, it is within the range of the configuration value `stats.executionTimesToTrack`), the node SHALL return the time, in nanoseconds, spent to directly process that transaction (that is, excluding time to reach consensus).<br/> Note that because each node processes every transaction for the Hedera network, this query MAY be sent to any node. <p> <blockquote>Important<blockquote> This query is obsolete, not supported, and SHALL fail with a pre-check result of `NOT_SUPPORTED`.</blockquote></blockquote> |
| uncheckedSubmit | [Transaction](#proto-Transaction) | [TransactionResponse](#proto-TransactionResponse) | Submit a transaction that wraps another transaction which will skip most validation. <p> <blockquote>Important<blockquote> This query is obsolete, not supported, and SHALL fail with a pre-check result of `NOT_SUPPORTED`. </blockquote></blockquote> |
