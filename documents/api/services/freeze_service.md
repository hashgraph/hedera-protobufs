### FreezeService
A service to manage network "freeze" events.

This service provides a facility to prepare for network upgrades, halt network processing,
perform network software upgrades, and automatically restart the network following an upgrade.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| freeze | [Transaction](#proto-Transaction) | [TransactionResponse](#proto-TransactionResponse) | Freeze, cancel, or prepare a freeze. This single transaction performs all of the functions supported by the network freeze service. These functions include actions to prepare an upgrade, prepare a telemetry upgrade, freeze the network, freeze the network for upgrade, or abort a scheduled freeze. <p> The actual freeze action SHALL be determined by the `freeze_type` field of the `FreezeTransactionBody`.<br/> The transaction body MUST be a `FreezeTransactionBody`. |
