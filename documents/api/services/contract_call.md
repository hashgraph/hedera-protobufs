### ContractCallTransactionBody
Call a function of a given smart contract, providing function parameter
inputs as needed.

Resource ("gas") charges SHALL include all relevant fees incurred by the
contract execution, including any storage required.<br/>
The total transaction fee SHALL incorporate all of the "gas" actually
consumed as well as the standard fees for transaction handling, data
transfers, signature verification, etc...<br/>
The response SHALL contain the output returned by the function call.

### Block Stream Effects
A `CallContractOutput` message SHALL be emitted for each transaction.


| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| contractID | [ContractID](#proto-ContractID) | The ID of a smart contract to call. |
| gas | [int64](#int64) | A maximum limit to the amount of gas to use for this call. <p> The network SHALL charge the greater of the following, but SHALL NOT charge more than the value of this field. <ol> <li>The actual gas consumed by the smart contract call.</li> <li>`80%` of this value.</li> </ol> The `80%` factor encourages reasonable estimation, while allowing for some overage to ensure successful execution. |
| amount | [int64](#int64) | An amount of tinybar sent via this contract call. <p> If this is non-zero, the function MUST be `payable`. |
| functionParameters | [bytes](#bytes) | The smart contract function to call. <p> This MUST contain The application binary interface (ABI) encoding of the function call per the Ethereum contract ABI standard, giving the function signature and arguments being passed to the function. |
