### ContractDeleteTransactionBody
Delete a smart contract, and transfer any remaining HBAR balance to a
designated account.

If this call succeeds then all subsequent calls to that smart
contract SHALL fail.

### Requirements
 - An account or smart contract MUST be designated to receive all remaining
   account balances.
 - The smart contract MUST have an admin key set. If the contract does not
   have `admin_key` set, then this transaction SHALL fail and response code
   `MODIFYING_IMMUTABLE_CONTRACT` SHALL be set.
 - If `admin_key` is, or contains, an empty `KeyList` key, it SHALL be
   treated the same as an admin key that is not set.
 - The `Key` set for `admin_key` on the smart contract MUST have a valid
   signature set on this transaction.
 - The designated receiving account MAY have `receiver_sig_required` set. If
   that field is set, the receiver account MUST also sign this transaction.
 - The field `permanent_removal` MUST NOT be set. That field is reserved for
   internal system use when purging the smart contract from state. Any user
   transaction with that field set SHALL be rejected and a response code
   `PERMANENT_REMOVAL_REQUIRES_SYSTEM_INITIATION` SHALL be set.

### Block Stream Effects
None


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| contractID | [ContractID](#proto-ContractID) |  | The id of the contract to be deleted. <p> This field is REQUIRED. |
| transferAccountID | [AccountID](#proto-AccountID) |  | An Account ID recipient. <p> This account SHALL receive all HBAR and other tokens still owned by the contract that is removed. |
| transferContractID | [ContractID](#proto-ContractID) |  | A contract ID recipient. <p> This contract SHALL receive all HBAR and other tokens still owned by the contract that is removed. |
| permanent_removal | [bool](#bool) |  | A flag indicating that this transaction is "synthetic"; initiated by the node software. <p> The consensus nodes create such "synthetic" transactions to both to properly manage state changes and to communicate those changes to other systems via the Block Stream.<br/> A user-initiated transaction MUST NOT set this flag. |
