   * There are three main cases to consider:
   *   1. The reward rate is zero because the node's starting stake was below its minStake.
   *   2. The node's stake was in the range [minStake, maxStake], and this is the "base" reward rate; namely,
   *           baseRewardRate = totalRewardRate / (totalStakeRewardStart / 100_000_000)
   *   3. The node's stake exceeded its maxStake, so this is a down-scaling of the base rate:
   *           scaledRewardRate = (baseRewardRate * stakeToReward) / maxStake
   * 
   * (In the degenerate case the node had zero stakeRewardStart, the reward rate is of course also zero.)
